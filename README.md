# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

As an employee with a busy schedule, I want to add important events to a daily planner so that I can manage my time effectively.

This work day scheduler has been achieved by:
* Creating a UI that displays today's date and below, shows time slots for the working day (9am - 5pm).
*  As the time changes throughout the day, the time slots change colour to allow the user to easier identify the time:
    * Grey - For previous time
    * Yellow - For current time
    * Green - For future time

* Each time slot allows the user to add their schedule info and save it so that if the page is refreshed or reloaded, their info persists for that current day.
    * When the save button is clicked, a message appears at the top of the planner to notify the user that the changes have been saved: ![screenshot shpwing save message appearing](./assets/images/work-scheduler-save-msg.JPG)

* When the current date changes, the scheduler resets ready to start adding that days schedule. 
    * Scheduler at 23:59 on 10th Dec 2023: ![screenshot of scheduler at 23:59 on 10th Dec 2023](./assets/images/work-scheduler-23-59.JPG)
